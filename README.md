# React Native Music Rating App

## About the App 

The code written by Kelleigh Entrekin and Aleks Jacewicz for our music app assigment for COMP333 at Wesleyan University.
This code makes up a mobile phone app consisting of registration and login pages for users to register and log into the app, as well as pages only accessible once the user is logged in. These include a "read" page where the user can read all the artist names and soong titles of previously written ratings and access a search bar, an "individual" page where all the data for a specific ratings can be seen and where delete and edit icons allow for deletion of the ratings/link to an appropriate page if the user logged in made the given post, a page where a new rating can be submitted, and a page where the existing post can be edited. 
## How to Run the App 

TBD 

To run the app using your local backend, you will need to edit the IP addresses in the url's in the following lines of code: 

> music-app\Components 
> > Register.js -- 55 <br> 
> > Login.js -- 29 <br>
> > Read.js -- 35, 61, 100 <br>
> > Individual.js -- 34, 73 <br>
> > Create.js -- 51 <br>
> > Update.js -- 37 <br>

<b>Important Note:<b> Everytime you make changes to the ratings data--i.e., deleting, editing, creating data--you need to refresh the Read component page by swiping your finger down to produce the swirling refresh icon.
